# Ultrasonic Fan Regulator

The project was developed in the Raspberry Pi environment, on the QT platform. The basic idea was to regulate the speed of rotation of the DC fan propeller using an ultrasonic sensor HCSR-04, accompanied by an interactive application where the user can change settings, modes, or track a graph displaying the parameter of the distance of the object from the sensor.
